  <h1 id="definition">Definition of IoT</h1>
  <p>
    The internet of things, or IoT, is a network of interrelated devices that connect and exchange data with other IoT
    devices and the cloud. IoT devices are typically embedded with technology such as sensors and software and can
    include mechanical and digital machines and consumer objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b> refers to the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with sensors,
    software, and other technologies. These objects are connected to the Internet, enabling them to collect and
    exchange data. IoT aims to extend Internet connectivity beyond traditional devices like desktops and laptops to
    everyday objects, enhancing their functionality and providing advanced analytics.
  </p>
  <p>
    IoT enables real-time data collection and sharing, which can lead to improved efficiency and innovation in
    various sectors. This technology allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely, creating opportunities for
    direct integration between the physical world and computer-based systems.
